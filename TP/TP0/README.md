To execute the provided Python files, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python files are located.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If the `requirements.txt` file is not present in the directory, you can skip this step.
4. To execute the test files, run the following commands:
   ```python
   python test1_v1.py
   python test2_v1.py
   python test2.py
   python test3.py
   python test4.py
   ```

   These commands will run the provided test cases for each exercise.
5. To execute the exercise files, run the following commands:
   ```
   python exercise1.py
   python exercise2.py
   python exercise3.py
   python exercise4.py
   python exercise5.py
   ```

   These commands will run the provided exercises.

Here's a brief description of the content of the exercise files:

- `exercise1.py`: This file contains a class called `Habitant` with methods for setting and getting attributes like `name`, `age`, `adresse`, and `dict_animals`.
- `exercise2.py`: This file contains a class called `Habitant` with a method called `calcul_nombre_annee_avant_retraite` that calculates the number of years until retirement based on the age of the habitant.
- `exercise3.py`: This file contains a class called `Habitant` with a method called `calcul_nombre_annee_avant_retraite` that calculates the number of years until retirement based on the age of the habitant. It also includes a method called `affichage` that prints the habitant's information.
- `exercise4.py`: This file contains a class called `Habitant` with a method called `calcul_nombre_annee_avant_retraite` that calculates the number of years until retirement based on the age of the habitant. It also includes a method called `affichage` that prints the habitant's information.
- `exercise5.py`: This file contains a class called `Habitant` with a method called `calcul_nombre_annee_avant_retraite` that calculates the number of years until retirement based on the age of the habitant. It also includes a method called `affichage` that prints the habitant's information.

Remember that the `test1_v1.py`, `test2_v1.py`, `test2.py`, `test3.py`, `test4.py` and `exercise5.py` files are test cases for the respective exercise files. You can run these test cases to verify the correctness of the exercises.
